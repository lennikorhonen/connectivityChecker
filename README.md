# Connectivity checker

## check.py
Use this to check sites in sites.txt. Edit those sites for your preference.

Run with
```bash
python3 check.py
```

## check_one.py
Use this to check just one site.

Run with
```bash
python3 check_one.py
```
Write the site without the https://

For eg: github.com


### TODO:

- [X] Add requirements.txt and guide how to get this version up and running
- [ ] Add connection timeout if site can't be reached in a certain amount of time
- [ ] Make a Flask app from this
- [ ] Dockerize the future Flask app
